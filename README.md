# Satellite Imagery-Based Property Valuation

## Overview
This project builds a **multimodal regression pipeline** to predict residential property prices by combining traditional tabular housing features with **satellite imagery**.

The motivation is to capture environmental and neighborhood context (green cover, road density, water proximity) that is not fully represented by numerical attributes alone.

---

## Objective
- Predict house prices using tabular + satellite image data
- Programmatically fetch satellite images using latitude and longitude
- Extract visual features using a CNN
- Fuse image embeddings with tabular features
- Compare tabular-only vs multimodal models

---

## Dataset

### Tabular Data
- Bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living, sqft_lot, floors, waterfront, etc.
- Latitude and longitude used for image retrieval
- Target variable: **price**

### Visual Data
- Satellite images fetched using **Mapbox Static Images API**
- Images captured at zoom level 18 (224×224)

## Repository Notes

Due to GitHub file size limits, the following artifacts are **not tracked in this repository**:

- Raw satellite images (`images/`)
- Intermediate NumPy embeddings (`*.npy`)
- Trained model files (`*.joblib`)
- Submission files (`*.csv`)

These files can be regenerated by running the notebooks in the order described below.

## Methodology

### 1. Image Acquisition
- Satellite images fetched using latitude and longitude
- Stored locally for training and inference

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Tabular features cleaned and normalized
- Image features extracted using **ResNet18**
- 512-dimensional embeddings reduced to 64 using PCA

### 3. Multimodal Fusion
- Tabular features concatenated with PCA-reduced image embeddings
- Final feature vector used for regression

---

## Models Used
- RandomForest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

---

## Results

| Model | RMSE | R² |
|------|------|----|
| Tabular Only / Initial Multimodal | 232,377.74 | 0.6829 |
| Multimodal RF | 232,377.74 | 0.6829 |
| **Multimodal RF + PCA** | **199,669.93** | **0.7659** |

The PCA-based multimodal RandomForest model achieved the best performance by reducing noise in image embeddings and improving generalization.

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- PIL / OpenCV
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib

## How to Run

### Step 1: Fetch Satellite Images
```bash
python data_fetcher.py

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Run `preprocessing.ipynb` to:

- Clean and normalize tabular features  
- Handle missing values  
- Align satellite images with property IDs  
- Prepare data for multimodal fusion  

---

## Step 3: Model Training

Run `model_training.ipynb` to:

- Train tabular-only baseline models  
- Train multimodal models using tabular + image data  
- Apply PCA on image embeddings  
- Evaluate model performance using **RMSE** and **R²**  

---

## Step 4: Generate Predictions

- Final predictions are saved as:
submission_rf_pca.csv

---

## Model Explainability

Satellite image embeddings allow the model to learn visual cues such as:

- Vegetation density  
- Road networks  
- Proximity to water bodies  

Grad-CAM based explainability can be applied to visualize image regions contributing most to property price prediction.

Due to time and computational constraints, Grad-CAM analysis is proposed as a **future enhancement**.

---

## Limitations

- Satellite images provide limited temporal information  
- Image resolution may miss fine-grained property details  
- Model performance depends on accuracy of location coordinates  
- Grad-CAM visual explanations were not fully implemented  

---

## Future Work

- Implement Grad-CAM visualizations for interpretability  
- Explore deeper CNN architectures  
- Use temporal satellite imagery for trend analysis  
- Deploy the model as a web-based valuation tool  

---

## Submission

The final prediction file (`submission_rf_pca.csv`) was uploaded to **Kaggle** for validation.

- Format verified: `id, price`  
- Submission accepted successfully  

Screenshots of submission confirmation are included in the project report.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that incorporating satellite imagery significantly improves real estate price prediction.

PCA-enhanced multimodal models achieved the best performance, highlighting the importance of environmental and neighborhood context in property valuation.
